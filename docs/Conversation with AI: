Conversation with AI:

Looking at the codebase, here are the key suggested changes again:
Installation Script Location:
Move install to scripts/install.sh to match other scripts
This maintains consistency with our script organization
Test Environment:
Create scripts/test-env.sh to handle test environment setup
Move from Makefile:
export PURR_TEST := 1
export PURR_ROOT := $(TEST_ROOT)
export PURR_DATA := $(TEST_ROOT)/.local/share
export PURR_CONFIG := $(TEST_ROOT)/.config
export PURR_CACHE := $(TEST_ROOT)/.cache
Version Management:
Replace hardcoded VERSION="0.0.1" in install script with:
VERSION=$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.1")
Logging Consistency:
Move logging functions from install script to src/lib/core/common.sh
Use the same logging functions across all scripts
5. Test Distribution Path:
Make test distribution path consistent:
TEST_DIST="tests/dev/dist/purr-test.tar.gz"
Shell Detection:
Improve shell detection to handle more edge cases
Add support for more shells
Cleanup Handling:
Make cleanup trap more comprehensive
Handle interrupted installations
Test Prerequisites:
Make test environment setup a prerequisite in Makefile
Ensure clean test environment for each test run
Error Messages:
Add more context to error messages
Include troubleshooting hints
Would you like me to explain any of these changes in more detail?
